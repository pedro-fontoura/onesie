I’ve always found that the true thrill isn't in winning the game, but in the challenge of building it. I love coding for the web—taking a blank screen and turning it into a seamless and pleasurable experience.

For me, the "win" is solving the logic and perfecting the engine. I build these games for the pure fun of the challenge, but I put them online for you.

Onesie is my labor of love, designed to be clean, distraction-free, and accessible to everyone. Whether you have a minute or an hour, I invite you to jump in and play a hand.

If you enjoy the experience, your feedback and support keep the engine running. Come see what I’ve been building!
